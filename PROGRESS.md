TODO:
* Add more psych sheet documents, along with schedule URLs to test on other meets
* Get FullMeet solver to return full solution instead of just printing
* Make automated tests with pytest to compare the SingleDay and FullMeet solvers, and different ranges of the FullMeet solver
* Make option to give current lineup when start_day isn't 1, so can solve for the remainder of a meet
* Figure out why it's hard to ^C out of lineup_optimizer program
* Simulate different cost formulas so not every swimmer costs 25 (come up with own formula based on projected points?)
* Try to derive cost formula from previous years?
* Scrape relay world records too for fun?
